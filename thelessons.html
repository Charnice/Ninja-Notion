      <button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        1. Imagine Yourself as a Ninja:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
              <p>The law of attraction applies strongly to this step. To summarise: if you imagine yourself as a ninja, you are more likely to become a ninja through the pooling of positive energy.</p>
          </div>
    <br><button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        2.	Understand that becoming a Ninja is not easy:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
              <p>Becoming a ninja often can challenge many socio-cultural norms, and may cause friction amongst family and friends. Take some time to tell those close to you about your intentions on becoming a ninja, what this will entail, how your lifestyle will change because of it, and how your closest will possibly be impacted.</p>
          </div>
    <br><button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        3.	Join a Local Community:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
              <p>Ninja communities are the first point of contact when commencing your journey to becoming a ninja. Be prepared for initiation rituals which are specific to each group and are essential to becoming accepted in the community. Click on this link to find out how to find your local community: ‘Find your Local Community’.</p>
          </div>
    <br><button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        4.	Balance theory with Physical Training:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
              <p>The ninja training courses are holistic, primarily focusing on theoretical knowledge, before implementing learnt information to intense physical training. During the physical training, you must continue to support, nourish and attend to the physiological requirements of the ninja training. Meditation is proven to be the most accessible mode through which to fulfil these needs.</p>
          </div>
    <br><button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        5.	Practise the Art of Stealth:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
              <p>Walking, running, creeping and hiding all need to be able to be completed in a way that is in essence stealthy. This will be covered in the Physical Training part of the Ninja programme; however, it is necessary to place an accent on perfecting these techniques, particularly before layering on the onerous Senses training. It is also beneficial to practice crouching on all fours, as well as walking on the tips of your toes in free time in between structured community training sessions.</p>
          </div>
    <br><button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        6.	Train your Senses:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
            <p>Meditation, breathing and mind yoga are When training your sense of smell, remember to use coffee granules as a cleaner regularly in between training sessions for the most effect use of time.</p>
          </div>
    <br><button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        7.	Start Spying:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
              <p>This is the stage of the course that students avidly look forward to. This step involves putting into practice all of the previous years of training, and being incorporated into a mission. Whilst normally novice ninjas start off in administrative roles, slowly progressing to minor participating roles, the details and extent of participation in the mission is at the discretion of your community, and some novice spies who show exceptional technique and potential have in the past been placed directly into leading roles.</p>

    <br><button class="collapsible"><div class="body-text-bold-white">
        8.	Specialise:</div></button>
          <div class="the-lessons-content">
              <p>Following the completion of the community course, you have an opportunity to use your learnt knowledge to find a specialism in your knew learnt art. Follow up Advanced Courses are available to those who find that they wish to specialise in a certain area, such as in the Submarine Terrain, Aviation or White Collar Crime cases.</p>
